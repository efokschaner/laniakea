- [ ] Add TSLint.
- [ ] Add leading underscores to private members.
- [ ] MTU/bandwidth aware replication (currently sends all state every frame).
- [ ] Use inter-frame times to send more state sync packets. This ties in with above.
- [ ] Automatic reconnection (as our connection is over UDP this is more about flushing and re-syncing simulation).
- [ ] Explore capnproto ts as a networking + gamestate option.
- [ ] Explore use of conventional web frameworks for 2D UI, with databindings to game state.
- [ ] Maybe eliminate BufferedRTCDataChannel if we just have handlers ready before the connection attempt?
- [ ] Maybe eliminate reliable RTCDataChannel as reliable can be implemented on top of unreliable with our protocol.
- [ ] Graphs / stats from network. Maybe expose for use by other systems.
- [ ] Review and move xxhashjs.d.ts typings to xxhashjs or DefinitelyTyped.
- [ ] Review and move box-intersect.d.ts typings to box-intersect or DefinitelyTyped.
- [ ] Figure out which of lk-demo-client's dependencies are actually devDependencies.
- Other TODO's still in the source code
